The market is flooded with cheap digital frames that promise simplicity but end up delivering washed-out displays, clunky apps and a frustrating experience — leading you to abandon it after a week.<br /><br />That’s a shame, because a good digital frame can be really enjoyable. Most of us have thousands of photos sitting on our phones that never make it beyond the camera roll, even though they’re exactly the kind of moments worth seeing every day. A solid frame gives those images a permanent home, whether it’s family photos cycling in the living room or shared albums updating automatically for relatives across the country. We’ve tested a range of smart photo frames to separate the genuinely useful options from the forgettable junk, and these are the ones that are actually worth putting on display.</p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-best-digital-picture-frames-for-2026">Best digital picture frames for 2026</h2> 
<p>

<p>
 </p> 
<h2 id="jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-digital-picture-frames">What to look for in digital picture frames</h2> 
<p>While a digital photo frame feels like a simple piece of tech, there are a number of things I considered when trying to find one worth displaying in my home. First and foremost was screen resolution and size. I was surprised to learn that most digital photo frames have a resolution around 1,200 x 800, which feels positively pixelated. (That''s for frames with screen sizes in the nine- to ten-inch range, which is primarily what I considered for this guide.)</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>But after trying a bunch of frames, I realized that screen resolution is not the most important factor; my favorite photos looked best on frames that excelled in reflectivity, brightness, viewing angles and color temperature. A lot of these digital photo frames were lacking in one or more of these factors; they often didn''t deal with reflections well or had poor viewing angles.</p> 
<p>A lot of frames I tested felt cheap and looked ugly as well, which isn’t something you want in a smart device that sits openly in your home. That includes lousy stands, overly glossy plastic parts and design decisions I can only describe as strange, particularly for items that are meant to just blend into your home. The best digital photo frames don''t call attention to themselves and look like an actual “dumb” frame, so much so that those that aren’t so tech-savvy might mistake them for one.</p> 
<p>Perhaps the most important thing outside of the display, though, is the software. Let me be blunt: a number of frames I tested had absolutely atrocious companion apps and software experiences that I would not wish on anyone. One that I tried did not have a touchscreen, but did have an IR remote (yes, like the one you controlled your TV with 30 years ago). Trying to use that with a Wi-Fi connection was painful, and when I tried instead to use a QR code, I was linked to a Google search for random numbers instead of an actual app or website. I gave up on that frame, the $140 PixStar, on the spot.</p> 
<p>Other things were more forgivable. A lot of the frames out there are basically Android tablets with a bit of custom software slapped on the top, which worked fine but wasn''t terribly elegant. And having to interact with the photo frame via touch wasn''t great because you end up with fingerprints all over the display. The best frames I tried were smart about what features you could control on the frame itself vs. through an app, the latter of which is my preferred method.</p> 
<p>Another important software note: many frames I tried require subscriptions for features that absolutely should be included out of the box. For example, one frame would only let me upload 10 photos at a time without a subscription. Others would let you link a Google Photos account, but you could only sync a single album without paying up. Yet another option didn''t let you create albums to organize the photos that were on the frame — it was just a giant scroll of photos with no way to give them order.</p> 
<p>While some premium frames offer perks like unlimited photos or cloud storage, they often come at a cost. I can understand why certain things might go under a subscription, like if you''re getting a large amount of cloud storage, for example. But these subscriptions feel like ways for companies to make recurring revenue from a product made so cheaply they can''t make any money on the frame itself. I''d urge you to make sure your chosen frame doesn''t require a subscription (neither of the frames I recommend in this guide need a subscription for any of their features), especially if you plan on giving this device as a gift to loved ones.</p>

<p>As suggested, these aren''t static 3D models. They are fully functional and interactive objects that move and react to players. The beta toolset can''t be used to make anything, as it''s rather limited for now. There are just two templates for users to choose from.

<p>The cars are fully driveable, however, and are made from five separate parts. The parts work independently of one another, allowing for spinning wheels and opening doors. The company says the physics should be accurate, so prepare for a whole lot of user-generated racing games.</p>
<p>There''s already a game on the platform that uses the 4D tools <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/113627622022152/Wish-Master"><ins>called </ins><em><ins>Wish Master</ins></em></a>. It lets players generate cars, planes and all kinds of other stuff.</p>

There were a ton of major changes, not least a format switch from 6v6 to 5v5, with one tank being dropped from each team — a contentious decision that has been walked back with <a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatch-2-will-test-6v6-role-queue-matches-starting-december-17-194524335.html" target="_blank">the return of 6v6 modes</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-01-blizzard-overwatch-2-blizzcon-gameplay-trailer.html" target="_blank">grand vision</a> Blizzard originally had for <em>Overwatch 2 </em>never quite came together.

May will mark its 10th anniversary (I have to imagine the team has something significant planned for that).

Jetpack Cat is alive after all, and is coming to <em>Overwatch </em>in a matter of days.</p><p>This is a support hero with a permanent flight ability who can &quot;tow&quot; an ally, carrying them through the air while healing them.

For example, <a class="link" href="https://x.com/AlexFinn/status/2013724043812446708" target="_blank">one post</a> that was viewed more than 350,000 times advises users that X &quot;will reward people who conversate&quot; and &quot;raise the vibrations of X.&quot; Another post with more than 20,000 views claims that <a class="link" href="https://x.com/robj3d3/status/2013569811763061035" target="_blank">posting video</a> is the answer. Another <a class="link" href="https://x.com/StarPlatinum_/status/2013568309946446066" target="_blank">post</a> says that users should stick to their &quot;niche&quot; because &quot;topic switching hurts your reach.&quot; But Thickstun cautioned against reading too much into supposed strategies for going viral. &quot;They can''t possibly draw those conclusions from what was released,&quot; he says.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are some small details that shed light on how X recommends posts — for example, it filters out content that''s more than a day old — Thickstun says that much of it is &quot;not actionable&quot; for content creators.&nbsp;</p><p>Structurally, one of the biggest differences between the current algorithm and the version released in 2023 is that the new system relies on a Grok-like large language model to rank posts. &quot;In the previous version, this was hard coded: you took how many times something was liked, how many times something was shared, how many times something was replied … and then based on that you calculate a score, and then you rank the post based on the score,&quot; explains Ruggero Lazzaroni, a pHD researcher at the University of Graz. &quot;Now the score is derived not by the real amounts of likes and shares, but by how likely Grok thinks that you would like and share a post.&quot;</p><p>That also makes the algorithm even more opaque than it was before, says Thickstun. &quot;So much more of the decisionmaking … is happening within black box neural networks that they''re training on their data,&quot; he says. &quot;More and more of the decisionmaking power of these algorithms is shifting not just out of public view, but actually really out of view or understanding of even the internal engineers that are working on these systems, because they''re being shifted into these neural networks.&quot;</p><p>The release has even less detail about some aspects of the algorithm that were made public in 2023. At the time, the company included information about how it weighted various interactions to determine which posts should rank higher. For example, a reply was &quot;worth&quot; 27 retweets and a reply that generated a response from the original author was worth 75 retweets. But X has now redacted information about how it''s weighing these factors, saying that this information was excluded &quot;for security reasons.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The code also doesn''t include any information about the data the algorithm was trained on, which could help researchers and others understand it or conduct audits. &quot;One of the things I would really want to see is, what is the training data that they''re using for this model,&quot; says Mohsen Foroughifar, an assistant professor of business technologies at Carnegie Mellon University. &quot;if the', 'Engadget', 'https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2026-02%2F5af8ba1a-2bb7-404b-af80-e7b64c662789&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=2d731bcf7f1dedfa2d330e1084c733211071cf75', 'Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18', 'published', 'x-s-open-source-algorithm-isn-t-a-win-for-transparency-re'),

We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> 
<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager.

Imagine asking for mental health advice and getting an ad for St. John''s wort or something.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="67f0c37fc7cf4181b5d90ad562da032f"></div>
<p>Anthropic notes that other conversations &quot;involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said that integrating advertising would &quot;work against&quot; the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/constitution"><ins>Claude Constitution</ins></a>, which counts &quot;being generally helpful&quot; as a core principle. &quot;Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results,&quot; it writes in a blog post.</p>
<p>There are some real world concerns here. AI companies <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-spending-to-hit-253-trillion-in-2026-333-trillion-in-2027-201834333.html"><ins>gobble up all money in sight</ins></a> and the returns <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/anthropic-is-bleeding-out/"><ins>haven''t exactly been stellar</ins></a>. Ads are an easy way to recoup some of that investment, which is likely why OpenAI went that route. Engadget reached out to Anthropic to inquire about any kind of forthcoming financial hurdles that could force it to change course. A representative pointed to today''s blog post and said it''s &quot;all the information we have to share at this time.&quot;</p>
<p>We do know that Anthropic remains committed to commerce-based agentic AI. It said it will &quot;continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare or buy products, connect with businesses and more.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-says-it-wont-bring-ads-to-claude-unlike-rival-chatgpt-171243642.html?src=rss', 'Engadget', 'https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2026-02%2Ff133f2b0-01e8-11f1-bff3-c3a0778000b1&resize=1400%2C895&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=0ddd387c177d1cb77edb02be802907557607e351', 'Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17', 'published', 'anthropic-says-it-won-t-bring-ads-to-claude-unlike-rival-ch'),

Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches.

Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.</p><figure><img alt="iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air" src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/a476c2e0-9780-11f0-bd4b-d87caa240702" style="height: 1263px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption>iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><h2 id="jump-link-display-and-the-crease-question">Display and the crease question</h2><p>The display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.</p><p>Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier.

The best Presidents’ Day deals are usually on mattresses, appliances and furniture, but you can find some decent tech sales thrown in as well. This year, Presidents’ Day comes right after Valentine’s Day and Super Bowl 2026, which means there are even more chances to save as sales and discounts overlap. If you’re looking for a new streaming device, a fresh iPad or an upgraded vacuum so you can enter the spring-cleaning season properly, we have you covered. These are the best President Day sales on tech we could find this year.</p>

<p>Apple released this iPad mini in late 2024 and it was a solid update. We gave it an 83 in our review thanks to the power of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-unveils-a17-pro-a-3nm-chip-powering-iphone-15-pro-182113747.html">A17 Pro chip</a> and that it comes with a minimum of 128GB of storage. The model currently on sale comes with 128GB, Wi-Fi and all four color options: Blue, Purple, Space Gray and Starlight.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>We named the Apple iPad mini <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">our favorite compact iPad</a> — though, to be fair, its only competitor is itself. Still, it''s a good iPad with an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, Apple Intelligence and 12MP Wide back and 12MP Ultra Wide cameras. For 20 percent off, it''s a great option for a light, useful way to entertain yourself through the rest of winter and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your current TV, now’s a decent time to do it. The weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are typically awash with TV deals to consider.</p>
<p>Generally, TV prices steadily decrease after a new model comes out. Some 2026 TV models were announced at CES and are forthcoming things year, making now a good time to look for discounts on 2025 sets. Aside from the holiday shopping season, now is one of the best times of the year to save on a TV. Here, we’ve curated the best Super Bowl TV deals we could find this year, from already affordable sets discounted even further to high-end OLEDs that are hundreds of dollars off.</p>
<h2 id="jump-link-super-bowl-2026-tv-deals-for-less-than-500">Super Bowl 2026 TV deals for less than $500</h2>
<p>You can easily find solid 1080p and 4K TV sets within this budget-friendly price range. What you’ll be more limited in is size — most TV deals under $500 we’re seeing right now are on sets up to 55 inches. There are a few 65- and 75-inch models in there, but the pickings are slim.</p>

<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an "essential accessory" for some users in his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> 
<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

It’s also apparently 50 percent louder and has a new, higher-pitched chime. Still no keyring hole, though.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>The new AirTag looks… the same. It’s arguably the most understated hardware design Apple has ever made, with no buttons or ports, just a company logo on one side. It’s made from a combination of a stainless steel plate and a (now 85-percent recycled) plastic enclosure. It’s like a thick coin, a little bigger than a quarter, and slips into any small pocket or wallet. The battery can be <a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-replace-your-airtag-battery-130000463.html" target="_blank">replaced by rotating the backing off</a>, but it''s still solid enough that I never felt there was a risk of coming off accidentally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple’s accessories to attach the AirTag to your keys are still more expensive than the tracker itself. However, compared to when the original tracker launched, there’s now a rich collection of third-party options from the likes of Mophie, Belkin and more, many of which are more reasonably priced at around $15.

<p>Setting up a new AirTag is just as <a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-set-up-an-airtag-120000789.html" target="_blank">effortless</a> as its predecessor. Pull out the plastic tag, connecting the battery, and a notification will pop up on your nearby iPhone. You can then name it, assign it to an item and it’ll join your list of findable Apple hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve been testing the range of the new AirTag, and if anything, the 50 percent increase in Precision Finding range is a conservative estimate. Naturally, tracking can be affected by building structure, walls, a lack of nearby Find My network devices and other interference, but the next-generation AirTag’s “getting closer” screen consistently appeared on my phone when I was around 80 feet away. The older tracker, however, needed me to be around 30-40 feet away to do the same. The benefit of Precision Finding was limited on the debut AirTag, because its range was so tiny — especially in busy environments. The hardware upgrades now make it truly useful. The new AirTag is also faster to connect and more responsive to my movements and sudden turns, ', 'Engadget', 'https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fairtag6_3260.jpg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=88584a746dabc8e32c7cccb2b593665c56de2c14', 'Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14', 'published', 'apple-airtag-2026-review-simply-better'),

<p>One of the biggest drawbacks is that the Beam only has one HDMI port. Regardless, that compromise may be easier to accept at Beam''s current $369 than at its usual $499.</p>

This format is pretty new, so there aren''t a ton of cards on the market.

<h2 id="jump-link-how-we-test-vr-headsets">How we test VR headsets</h2> 
<p>I tend to judge candidates for the best VR headset on a few basic criteria: Ergonomics, immersion and controls. It''s not that hard to shove a mobile display into a plastic headset and strap some cheap elastic headbands onto it. But it takes real design skill to craft something that''s well balanced, includes a supportive headstrap, and doesn''t feel uncomfortable after 30 minutes.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>My test for ergonomics is fairly simple: How long can I wear a headset until I start to feel discomfort? For the most ergonomic devices, like the Quest 3, that could easily be an hour or two. But heavier PC hardware often feels cumbersome after just 15 minutes — you won’t find those kinds of devices in our list of the best VR headsets.</p> 
<p>Immersion, meanwhile, comes from having high resolution screens with fast refresh rates, like a 120Hz refresh rate, helping users feel fully present inside a virtual world. Field of view is also a major element, as it describes how well VR screens can cover what you see. A narrow FOV makes it feel like you''re peering through a pair of binoculars, which limits your sense of “presence.” The best VR headsets aim for a wider field of view, helping virtual environments feel more natural and fully surround you.</p> 
<p>A wide field of view, on the other hand, can make it seem like you’re actually flying over the globe in Google Earth. We look at a few popular video games, like <em>Superhot</em>, <em>Beat Saber </em>and <em>Pistol Whip</em>, on every headset to judge how immersed we feel and how enjoyable the gaming experience is overall.</p> 
<p>The best controllers fit naturally in your hands and offer accurate tracking. The industry has basically adopted the design of Meta’s excellent touch controllers, but we''re also seeing intriguing leaps forward like Valve''s finger tracking gamepads. We judge controllers based on how easy they are to hold, how they hold up to sweaty gameplay sessions and how easily headsets can track their position in space.</p> 
<p>However, it’s important to look at a virtual reality headset’s specs as a whole, including compatibility with your existing hardware and the kind of experiences you plan to use it for. Depending on what you’re looking for in yourVR headset, you’ll want to consider factors like your PC’s CPU and graphics card if you plan to use the headset to play the best VR games. You might not need a super powerful PC, but you should check the minimum requirements for the headset you’re looking to purchase. If you’re not looking to invest in a VR headset solely for gaming, features like head tracking allow you to explore your environment just by simply moving your head in the simulator. This often results in a more immersive and realistic experience.</p>

In a gaming PC, the GPU is easily the most important part, and you can limit your experience by going with the wrong model. The buying process can be frustrating, especially right now with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/crucial-is-a-casualty-of-ais-hunger-for-ram-185910113.html">memory shortages</a> leading to higher prices.

<h2 id="jump-link-its-all-about-the-games">It''s all about the games</h2>
<p>The first question to ask yourself is what kind of games do you want to play. Competitive shooters like <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Marvel Rivals </em>were designed to run on older hardware. As such, even entry-level GPUs like the GeForce RTX 5060 can push those games at 120 frames per second and above at 1080p (more on why that''s important in a moment).</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>By contrast, if you want to play modern, single-player games with ray tracing and other graphical extras, you''ll need a more powerful GPU. Just how much more powerful will depend on the resolution of your monitor.</p>
<p>A 1440p or QHD monitor has 78 percent more pixels than a 1080p screen, and a 4K display has more than twice as many pixels as a QHD panel. In short, running a game at 4K, especially at anything above 60 frames per second, is demanding, and most GPUs will need to use upscaling techniques like NVIDIA''s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and AMD''s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) to push new games at high refresh rates.</p>
<p>On the subject of resolution, it doesn''t make sense to spend a lot of money on a 4K monitor only to pair it with an inexpensive GPU. That''s a recipe for a bad experience. As you''re shopping for a new video card, you should think about the resolution and frame rate you want to play your games. If you''re in the market for both a GPU and display, be sure to check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/best-gaming-monitor-140008940.html">best gaming monitors</a>.</p>
<p>If your budget allows, a good bet is to buy a midrange card that can comfortably render all but the most demanding games at 1440p and at least 144 frames per second. Put another way, you want a GPU that can saturate a monitor at its native resolution and refresh rate in as many games as possible. That will give you the smoothest possible experience in terms of motion clarity, and allow you to dabble in both competitive shooters and the latest single-player games as the mood strikes you.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-nvidia-vs-amd-and-intel">NVIDIA vs AMD and Intel</h2>
<p>One of the confusing aspects of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-gpu-market-is-built-on-a-broken-foundation-143100986.html">GPU industry are all the players involved</a>. What you need to know is that there are three main players: AMD, Intel and NVIDIA. They design the cards you can buy, but delegate the manufacturing of them to so-called add-in board (AIB) partners like ASUS, XFX, Gigabyte and others.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this creates some headaches. The most annoying of which is that AMD, Intel and NVIDIA will often set recommended prices for their graphic cards, only for their partners to sell their versions of those GPUs for more than the manufacturer''s suggested retail price (MSRP). For example, NVIDIA''s website lists the RTX 5070 with a starting price of $549. On Newegg, there are no new <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6ce976db-26d7-4094-a1be-4d1496b213f0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=7676f70e-877d-4293-afe3-fdbc21e98c7c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Newegg&amp;linkText=5070s+listed+at+that+price&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdlZ2cuY29tL3AvcGw_ZD1SVFgrNTA3MCZPcmRlcj0xIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3Njc2ZjcwZS04NzdkLTQyOTMtYWZlMy1mZGJjMjFlOThjN2MiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2VnZy5jb20vcC9wbD9kPVJUWCs1MDcwJk9yZGVyPTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ2F8SZhY3upQlXMzs4XYPjfLiB-PVBmTQVX2amoKJiv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2Fpl%3Fd%3DRTX%2B5070%26Order%3D1">5070s listed at that price</a>. The only models anywhere close to $549 are refurbished and open box specials. If you want one that comes sealed, that will cost you at least $630.</p>

[French officials have] accused X of manipulating its algorithm for ''foreign interference'' purposes, an allegation which is completely false.”</p><p><strong>Update, Feb 3 2026, 4:00pm ET: </strong> X posted a <a class="link" href="https://x.com/GlobalAffairs/status/2018773488602095916" target="_blank">lengthly statement</a> on its Global Government Affairs account, calling the allegations “baseless” and stating the company “categorically denies any wrongdoing.” The company went on to describe the raid as “an abusive act of law enforcement theater designed to achieve illegitimate political objectives rather than advance legitimate law enforcement goals.” </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-paris-hq-raided-by-french-prosecutors-110411170.html?src=rss', 'Engadget', 'https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2F2026-02%2F35ca5b50-6b1b-4317-9d18-5792f54ef678&resize=1400%2C933&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=f29d661fdd4a466561f80c9d4b0f8bb3bd076bc0', ' ue, 03 Feb 2026 21Z', 'published', 'x-s-paris-hq-raided-by-french-prosecutors'),

The new release expands on the AI features the company introduced with Xcode 26 at WWDC 2025 to give systems like Claude and ChatGPT more robust access to its in-house IDE.&nbsp;</p><p>With the update, Apple says Claude and OpenAI''s Codex &quot;can search documentation, explore file structures, update project settings, and verify their work visually by capturing Xcode Previews and iterating through builds and fixes.&quot; This is in contrast to earlier releases of Xcode 26 where those same agents were limited in what they could see of a developer''s Xcode environment, restricting their utility. According to Apple, the change will give users tools they can use to streamline their processes and work more efficiently than before. </p><p>Developers can add Claude and Codex to their Xcode terminal from the Intelligence section of the app''s setting menu. Once a provider is selected, the interface allows users to also pick their preferred model. So if you like the outputs of say GPT 5.1 over GPT 5.2, you can use the older system.&nbsp;</p><p>The tighter integration with Claude and Codex was made possible by Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers Apple has deployed. MCP is a technology Anthropic debuted in <a class="link" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol" target="_blank">fall 2024</a> to make it easier for large language models like Claude to share data with third-party tools and systems. Since its introduction, MCP has become an industry standard — with OpenAI, for instance, <a class="link" href="https://community.openai.com/t/introducing-support-for-remote-mcp-servers-image-generation-code-interpreter-and-more-in-the-responses-api/1266973" target="_blank">adopting the protocol</a> last year to facilitate its own set of connections.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple says it worked directly with Anthropic and OpenAI to optimize token usage through Xcode, but the company’s adoption of MCP means developers will be able to add any coding agent that supports the protocol to their terminal in the future. Xcode 26.3 is available to download for all members of the Apple Developer Program starting today, with the Mac Store availability “coming soon.”   </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-just-made-xcode-better-for-vibe-coding-195653049.html?src=rss', 'Engadget', 'https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FApple-Xcode-agentic-coding-hero_big.jpg.large.jpg&resize=1400%2C934&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=664008f87a14f03be43770d3068c87417893e354', ' ue, 03 Feb 2026 19Z', 'published', 'apple-just-made-xcode-better-for-vibe-coding'),

The app is particularly focused on the &quot;CEO of the family&quot; —  the person who manages appointments, prescriptions and other health-related tasks.</p><p>But the definition of family isn''t limited to parents raising children. The company sees its tool as especially valuable for caregivers in their 40s and 50s who may be managing the needs of both aging parents and kids. It even tracks pets'' health habits.</p><p>&quot;We''re managing care across three generations — kids at home, busy parents in the middle, and my dad in his 80s who''s living with diabetes and still wants to stay fiercely independent,&quot; Friedman wrote. &quot;And the moments that matter most are often the most chaotic: a late-night fever, a sudden urgent care visit, a doctor asking questions you can''t answer quickly because the details are scattered.&quot;</p><figure><img alt="Screenshot from the Luffu app. &quot;Family morning brief&quot; summarizes everyone''s health habits." src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/luffu.jpg" style="height: 720px; width: 1200px;" /><figcaption>The app''s AI includes a Morning Brief that recaps everyone''s health.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Luffu</div></figure><p>The company claims the app''s AI &quot;isn''t a chatbot layer.&quot; Rather, it serves as a &quot;guardian&quot; — proactively monitoring for changes silently in the background. The AI then provides insights and triggers alerts when something is out of whack. You can also ask the app health data questions using plain language (so, there is some kind of chatbot) and share data with family members.</p><p>The company clearly wants to make entering data as easy as possible. Luffu allows family members to log info using voice, text or photos. It integrates with health platforms such as Apple Health and Fitbit. And the company eventually wants to expand into a hardware ecosystem — presumably, devices that make health data collection even easier.</p><p>Speaking of data collection, Luffu says, &quot;Users are always in control of exactly what is shared, with whom, and privacy and security are paramount for all family data.&quot; In addition, the company <a class="link" href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/03/fitbit-founders-ai-family-caregiving" target="_blank">told <em>Axios</em></a> that users can choose whether their data is used to train its AI. On the other hand, Big Tech has repeatedly shown that its most egregious data-collection practices are always wrapped in comforting language. So, at the very least, I''d take their pitch with grains of salt and, most importantly, make sure each family member knows exactly what they''re consenting to. After all, this is a for-profit company, and we don’t yet know its monetization strategy.</p><p>Luffu is currently taking waitlist sign-ups for a forthcoming limited public beta.

<p>The sound quality is extremely pleasing to the ears, thanks to new audio drivers and a team of mastering engineers that assisted with tuning. There are perforations in the driver''s voice coil, which extends high frequency reproduction.</p> 
<p>The design has been upgraded from the previous iteration and we found them extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is important with headphones. The battery gets around 30 hours, which is a fairly standard metric for this type of thing.&nbsp;</p>

On this page, I''ll share the costs for top VPN services, calculate the industry average and explain what makes VPNs cost as much as they do. At the end, I''ll share a few tips for making a VPN fit your budget.</p><h2 id="jump-link-how-much-is-a-vpn"><strong>How much is a VPN?</strong></h2><p>I''d like to start by introducing the complexity of the problem. If you just want the numbers, you’ll find those in the sections below.</p><p>The main thing that makes VPNs so hard to budget for is that providers aren''t always honest about how much they''re charging. They rarely lie outright, but they often overcomplicate their pricing structures and hide increases in the fine print.</p><p>Let''s take CyberGhost as an example, since <a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/cyberghost-vpn-review-despite-its-flaws-the-value-is-hard-to-beat-200000250.html" target="_blank">I just reviewed it</a>. A one-month subscription to CyberGhost costs $12.99 — simple enough. However, you can also get a six-month subscription by paying $41.94 upfront, though the website more prominently calls this &quot;$6.99 per month.&quot; Finally, you can pay $56.94 for a 28-month subscription, but only once; after that, it''ll be $56.94 for a year.</p><figure><img alt="These prices are subject to change." src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/CyberGhost_pricing_4053.png" style="height: 1576px; width: 3418px;" /><figcaption>These prices are subject to change.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>As you can see in the image, the website heavily emphasizes the average monthly price, in text that dwarfs the actual price you''ll pay at checkout. This gets even worse with services like <a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> that have multiple tiers of subscription as well as multiple durations. It''s not uncommon to see 10 or more prices quoted for the exact same VPN.</p><p>The best way to cut through the confusion and shop on your own terms is to compare different VPNs at the same duration and subscription tier. For example, you could find the cost of one year of the most basic available plan, since most basic subscriptions still include full VPN service. In the next two sections, I''ll compare and average the basic tiers of my top seven VPNs at the monthly and yearly levels.</p><h3 id="jump-link-average-monthly-cost-of-a-vpn"><strong>Average monthly cost of a VPN</strong></h3><p>Here''s what the best VPNs cost per month. The numbers below are for subscribing to one month at a time, excluding any discounts and special deals.</p><ul><li><p>Proton VPN: $9.99</p></li><li><p>ExpressVPN: $12.99</p></li><li><p>Surfshark: $15.45</p></li><li><p>NordVPN: $12.99</p></li><li><p>CyberGhost: $12.99</p></li><li><p>Mullvad: $5.98 (depends on dollar/euro exchange rate)</p></li><li><p><a class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9e251e36-74b6-419a-8a7b-de182315da42&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fac04803-35b8-43c9-8be5-eca5a7af23b6&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hide.me&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vaGlkZS5tZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmFjMDQ4MDMtMzViOC00M2M5LThiZTUtZWNhNWE3YWYyM2I2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vaGlkZS5tZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQxXmIdEkRZetTLrWL_U3NT88eg0yDKJNMef4IZTkcht&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fhide.me" target="_blank"></a><a class="link" target="_blank">hide.me</a>: $11.99</p></li><li><p><strong>Average: $11.77</strong></p></li></ul><p>As you can see, $12.99 is a normal price for one month of a VPN — but the average price is somewhat lower, as several providers sell monthly plans for less. In general, expect to pay in the range between $10 and $13. Companies like Surfshark sometimes inflate their monthly prices in a bid to drive more traffic toward the longer plans.</p><p>Mullvad is also an outlier, since you can only ever subscribe to it month-by-month. There are other outliers, such as Astrill, which costs a whopping $30 per month. But the above holds true for all the best-regarded providers.</p><h3 id="jump-link-average-yearly-cost-of-a-vpn"><strong>Av', 'Engadget', 'https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2FIMG_4166.JPG&resize=1400%2C1050&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=606ea16386d5cee84829740d18941b4ff22a9cec', ' ue, 03 Feb 2026 17Z', 'published', 'how-much-do-vpns-cost'),

<p>. It costs $600. The company says this is the "world''s slimmest vacuum cleaner." We haven''t broken out any rulers to confirm that statement, but it''s certainly a ridiculously thin stick vac.</p>
<p>It achieves this thinness by using a motor inspired by the company''s</p>
<p>. This is a small motor that can actually rest in the shaft, so there''s not a noticeable bulge where the components have been placed. This stick vacuum is actually, well, a stick. Just take a look at it.</p>

</figure>
<p>It does come with attachments that increase the size a bit. For instance, the conical brush bar cleaner head makes it resemble a traditional stick vacuum. However, everything else is in the long cylinder. This includes the bin, filter and motor.</p>
<p>Other attachments include something called the "Fluffycones" cleaner head. This has four cones in two brush bars that rotate in opposite directions to "strip and eject even long hair, preventing hair tangling around the brush bar." There are also lights at both ends to help illuminate any lingering dust particles.</p>

<p>It weighs nearly four pounds and features the same diameter throughout. This makes it easy to grip anywhere along the body, which can help with overhead cleaning. It ships with a swappable battery pack that lasts for around an hour and there''s a magnetic charging dock to get things juiced up.</p>
<p>The vacuum works with the MyDyson app, which lets users check on battery life and adjust settings. Some of this information is also displayed on the LCD screen at the top of the handle.</p>
<p>We got a chance to try it out last year and came away impressed. The motor is plenty powerful, despite the diminished size, and the device was easy to maneuver. If you have $600 to spare and a dirty home, this could be a good purchase.</p>

It also has more ports than most thin and light machines, its OLED screen is great for productivity work and at three pounds it''s easy to carry around all day. But curse its mechanical trackpad — why does it even exist when Apple, Microsoft and others have been able to implement excellent haptic touchpads for years? Come on now.</p>

<h2 id="jump-link-hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>With its grey case, subdued design and somewhat chunky bezels, the MSI Prestige 14 Flip AI+ doesn''t exactly make a striking impression. From afar, you can tell it''s certainly thin, and it''s also clear that MSI made the most of its slim case by shoving in two USB-A ports, two USB-C connections, a single HDMI port and a headphone jack. It would have been nice to have some sort of SD card slot too, but at least the Prestige 14 can connect to older accessories, monitors and TVs without a USB-C hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you pick it up, though, the Prestige 14''s three-pound frame feels downright remarkable. It''s just a tad heavier than the 2.7-pound MacBook Air, but its screen size directly competes with the 3.4- to 3.6-pound 14-inchMacBook Pro. The "Flip" in its name also means it’s versatile, with the ability to rotate its screen into a tablet mode, or a variety of tent configurations.</p>
<p>What makes the MSI Prestige 14 Flip AI+ truly interesting is its Intel Core Ultra X7 358H processor, which features 16 cores and a maximum speed of 4.8GHz. Specifically, it features four P-cores for speedy performance, eight efficient E-cores and four low-power E-cores. The Ultra X7 is also one of the new Panther Lake chips with gobs of graphics power in Intel''s Arc B390 GPU, giving them far more gaming chops than previous ultraportable chips. The laptop also sports 32GB of RAM, which is the ideal amount for serious productivity work, and a roomy 1TB SSD.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Prestige 14''s stylus-friendly 14-inch OLED screen helps to distract from its mundane case design, with the typical deep black levels and excellent contrast I appreciate from OLED, together with bold 100 percent DCI-P3 color coverage. It makes just about everything look great, though I wish MSI offered more than a 60Hz refresh rate — a 90Hz or 120Hz screen would make scrolling through web pages look far smoother.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And speaking of the stylus, that’s tucked away at the bottom of the Prestige 14. I didn’t find it particularly useful for notetaking, but for those who do it’s easy to stow away. It’s just too thin for extended handwriting, and anyone doing serious notetaking or digital art would be better off with a larger stylus or dedicated drawing pad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After seeing a relatively slim Lenovo Panther Lake laptop <a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/intels-core-ultra-series-3-let-me-play-battlefield-6-at-190-fps-on-a-lenovo-ultraportable-220952246.html" target="_blank">reaching 190 fps in Battlefield 6</a>, using only Intel''s built-in Arc B390 GPU, I was eager to see how that new hardware would perform in the real world. Simply put, the MSI Prestige 14 Flip AI+ didn''t disappoint. It scored 10,169 points in PCMark 10, the highest score we''ve seen yet on a Windows PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, that includes plenty of powerful gaming systems like the Alienware 16 Area 51 (8,245 points) and the Razer Blade 18 (7,703), both of which were running Intel''s last-gen Core Ultra 9 275HX chip. Of course, those systems have faster GPUs, like NVIDIA''s RTX 5080, but PCMark 10 doesn''t lean too heavily on graphics performance. The Prestige 14 edged close to the M5 MacBook Pro in Geekbench 6''s multi-threaded CPU test, scoring 16,633 points compared to Apple''s 18,003.

It marks the band''s first performance after almost four years — the members took a hiatus to complete South Korea''s mandatory military service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The live concert will air on Saturday, March 21, one day after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bts-butter-breaks-youtube-views-record-182543703.html">BTS</a> releases their new album <em>Arirang</em> and will be aptly titled <em>BTS The Comeback Live | Arirang</em>. The show will physically take place in Seoul''s Gwanghwamun Square and stream live at 8PM KST/7 AM ET/4 AM ET. Yes, viewers in the US will have to choose between a really early Saturday or a <em>very</em> late Friday night. Alternatively, you can skip out on any potential livestream glitches and likely watch it later (or catch the K-Pop group on their upcoming world tour).&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Plus, come Friday, March 27, Netflix will be releasing <em>BTS: The Return</em>, a documentary all about the making of <em>Arirang.</em> As Netflix puts it: "The film offers rare behind-the-scenes access as the group comes back together and charts an unprecedented path forward together after a nearly four-year hiatus."</p>
<p>Netflix has leaned further into livestreaming over the last few years — though the BTS concert is arguably their biggest coup.

Social media companies will be required to implement what he calls &quot;effective age verification systems&quot; and &quot;not just checkboxes.&quot; A specific timeline on enforcement of the coming ban has not been announced.</p>
<p>Spain will also make &quot;algorithmic manipulation and amplification of illegal content&quot; into a new criminal offense and Sanchez says tech CEOs will face criminal liability for hateful or illegal content on their platforms. The Prime Minister further announced that Spain has formed a coalition with five other unnamed European nations to enact stricter governance over social media platforms.</p>
<p>Sanchez said children have been “exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone,” and that it’s the government’s job to intervene. He added social media has fallen from its promise to be a “tool for global understanding and cooperation.”</p>

<p>Once again, <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> relies on the series'' familiar mix of topspin, slice and flat (power) shots used in previous games. The big new mechanic for this title is that instead of Zone Shots from <em>Mario Tennis Aces</em>, you can equip each character with a different racket, similar to how you can choose between a range of vehicles in <em>Mario Kart. </em>Every racket features a different special ability that you can charge up by rallying back and forth. When the gauge is full, you can unleash a Fever Shot to potentially devastating results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, the Fire Racket turns the ball into a fireball that leaves multiple embers on the court. If your opponent gets burned, they will slowly lose health, which will make them move slower or knock them out (but only temporarily) if you''re playing doubles. Alternatively, the Pokey Racket can summon the <a class="link" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Pokey" target="_blank">giant cactus monster</a> it''s named after onto the court, which not only blocks your view but gets in the way as you chase down shots. And just like the game''s large stable of characters (38 in total), there are almost just as many different Fever Rackets (30) to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing I like most is that compared to special shots in previous titles, Fever Shots have built-in counterplay. Zone Shots from <em>Mario Tennis Aces</em> sometimes made it feel like you were playing a fighting game as people battled to conserve meter, while signature moves in <em>Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash </em>often turned into automatic points. If someone sends a Fever Shot at you, you can send it back simply by returning the ball before it bounces. This naturally sets up some frenetic sequences as characters try to volley back and forth without letting the ball hit the ground in order to prevent the Fever Shot from taking effect on their side of the court. This is exactly the kind of chaos that makes Mario Tennis so fun — it just feels a bit more balanced now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, if you prefer a different kind of mayhem, there are also new Wonder Court Matches, which borrow the titular blue flower seeds from <a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-the-joy-of-pure-imagination-141108387.html" target="_blank">Mario''s most recent 2D platformer</a>. This game mode nixes Fever Rackets in favor of changing up the rules of the sport on the fly in weird and unexpected ways. Don''t be surprised when you have a hard time hitting seeds with your shots to activate wondrous effects while spike balls get tossed at you or a parade of piranha decides to have a party on top of the net.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn''t able to play <em>Mario Tennis Fever''s </em>Adventure mode, which is a bit of a shame as I''ve heard that it''s deeper and more fleshed out. This is a welcome upgrade from the somewhat thin single-player campaign from <em>Aces</em>. Thankfully, the game still supports motion controls for younger players or anyone who''d rather swing a virtual racket instead of mashing buttons. I also appreciate that Nintendo is making it easy to get into multiplayer matches, as the game supports both online matches (ranked and unranked) and local wireless connectivity (LAN). For the latter, you can also use the Switch 2''s Game Share feature to send the title to other nearby systems so people can try out <em>Mario Tennis Fev', 'Engadget', 'https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fimgi_1_86a26a6d9a870eee16d0ff1b5591f055d63dee475fe688c42c46fcd96a199805.jpeg&resize=1400%2C787&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=e2e9fda362cc7524e340ede27858422ccb28e17c', ' ue, 03 Feb 2026 14Z', 'published', 'mario-tennis-fever-preview-a-racket-smashing-blast'),

After getting an early demo of Nintendo''s new accessory, I can confirm that this thing feels just as weird and quirky as it did when it first came out more than 30 years ago.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="The biggest difference on the new model is that it uses the Switch 2''s screen as its main display and processor.

It still features that classic red and black color scheme along with a stand for propping it up. The biggest difference is that instead of having a built-in display, there''s a slot where you can slide in a Switch 2 (with its Joy-Con detached). This brings several advantages: Since the Switch 2 has its own battery, there''s no need for cords anymore. It also means you don''t have to worry about swapping in individual game carts, as software can be downloaded directly from Nintendo''s online store. Graphics also look much sharper than I remember, though I admit that could just be me getting old. Finally, instead of reviving the Virtual Boy''s archaic gamepad, Nintendo smartly opted to let us use the Switch 2''s current lineup of controllers. The end result is a design that''s faithful to the original but doesn''t suffer from many of the pitfalls that plagued so many 90s gadgets — like tangled wires, awkward controls and fuzzy displays.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="One thing Nintendo didn''t change is Virtual Boy''s monochrome red visuals.

Unlike every other contemporary VR headset, you still don''t strap the new Virtual Boy onto your face. Instead, you have to adjust its bipod so that its facemask is level with your face and then you kind of just lean in to immerse yourself in a world where red is the only color. It''s definitely a bit awkward, but it works. Nintendo even included a way to adjust IPD, so visuals look just as crisp (if not moreso) as they did on the original.</p><p>That said, the clunkiest thing about the Virtual Boy is its games. While Nintendo updated its exterior and internals, the company didn''t really mess with its software — for better and worse. This means you get a relatively unadulterated look at where people thought VR was headed 30 years ago, which becomes immediately evident as soon as you boot into one of the console''s first seven games. <em>Galactic Pinball</em> is slow and trying to time when to hit the flippers to prevent the ball from getting past you is an exercise in frustration. Meanwhile, <em>Red Alarm </em>feels like a cheap port of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_(1980_video_game)" target="_blank"><em>Battlezone</em></a>, just with a vaguely Arwing-shaped plane instead of a tank. And once again, the pacing on this aerial shooter is glacial. Then there''s <em>3D Tetris</em>, which just kind of hurts your head as you try to drop pieces from a top-down perspective while the entire stage pivots around and never stops moving. The only title that really stands out is <em>Virtual Boy Wario Land</em>, which was and still is the best game on the entire platform.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="There''s no getting around it, the Virtual Boy''s bipod is just kind of awkward." src="https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/virtual-boy-front.jpg" style="height: 2000px; width: 3333px;" /><figcaption>There''s no getting around it, the Virtual Boy''s bipod', 'Engadget', 'https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fvirtual-boy-lead.jpg&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=24ba635eb55a252ecdbf9dd008b5ab85978dc5de', ' ue, 03 Feb 2026 14Z', 'published', 'the-switch-2-s-virtual-boy-is-a-tribute-to-nintendo-s-wackie'),

This is particularly true in real-time ordering systems like <a href="https://www.instacart.com/">Instacart</a>. </p><p>Instacart CTO Anirban Kundu calls it the &quot;brownie recipe problem.&quot; </p><p>It&#x27;s not as simple as telling an LLM ‘I want to make brownies.’ To be truly assistive when planning the meal, the model must go beyond that simple directive to understand what’s available in the user’s market based on their preferences — say, organic eggs versus regular eggs — and factor that into what’s deliverable in their geography so food doesn’t spoil. This among other critical factors. </p><p>For Instacart, the challenge is juggling latency with the right mix of context to provide experiences in, ideally, less than one second’s time. </p><p>“If reasoning itself takes 15 seconds, and if every interaction is that slow, you&#x27;re gonna lose the user,” Kundu said at a recent VB event. </p><h2><b>Mixing reasoning, real-world state, personalization</b></h2><p>In grocery delivery, there’s a “world of reasoning” and a “world of state” (what’s available in the real world), <!-- -->Kundu<!-- --> noted, both of which must be understood by an LLM along with user preference. But it’s not as simple as loading the entirety of a user’s purchase history and known interests into a reasoning model. </p><p>“Your LLM is gonna blow up into a size that will be unmanageable,” said Kundu. </p><p>To get around this, Instacart splits processing into chunks. First, data is fed into a large foundational model that can understand intent and categorize products. That processed data is then routed to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/next-big-thing-ai-think-small-models-venturebeat-yyrte">small language models (SLMs) </a>designed for catalog context (the types of food or other items that work together) and semantic understanding. </p><p>In the case of catalog context, the SLM must be able to process multiple levels of details around the order itself as well as the different products. For instance, what products go together and what are their relevant replacements if the first choice isn&#x27;t in stock? These substitutions are “very, very important” for a company like Instacart, which Kundu said has “over double digit cases” where a product isn’t available in a local market. </p><p>In terms of semantic understanding, say a shopper is looking to buy healthy snacks for children. The model needs to understand what a healthy snack is and what foods are appropriate for, and appeal to, an 8 year old, then identify relevant products. And, when those particular products aren’t available in a given market, the model has to also find related subsets of products. </p><p>Then there’s the logistical element. For example, a product like ice cream melts quickly, and frozen vegetables also don’t fare well when left out in warmer temperatures. The model must have this context and calculate an acceptable deliverability time. </p><p>“So you have this intent understanding, you have this categorization, then you have this other portion about logistically, how do you do it?”, Kundu noted. </p><h2>Avoiding &#x27;monolithic&#x27; agent systems</h2><p>Like many other companies, Instacart is experimenting with AI agents, finding that a mix of agents works better than a “single monolith” that does multiple different tasks. The Unix philosophy of a modular operating system with smaller, focused tools helps address different payment systems, for instance, that have varying failure modes, Kundu explained. </p><p>“Having to build all of that within a single environment was very unwieldy,” he said. Further, agents on the back end talk to many third-party platforms, including point-of-sale (POS) and catalog systems. Naturally, not all of them behave the same way; some are more reliable than others, and they have different update intervals and feeds. </p><p>“So being able to handle all of those things, we&#x27;ve gone down this route of microagents rather than agents that are dominantly large in nature,” said Kundu. </p><p>To manage agents, Instacart has integrated with <a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/">OpenAI’s model context protocol</a> (MCP), which standardizes and simplifies the process of connecting AI models to different tools and data sources. </p><p>The company also uses Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) open standard, which allows AI agents to directly interact with merchant systems. </p><p>However, Kundu&#x27;s team still deals with challenges. As he noted, it&#x27;s not about whether integration is possible, but how reliably those integrations behave and how well they&#x27;re understood by users. Discovery can be difficult, not just in identifying available services, but understanding which ones are appropriate for which task.</p><p>Instacart has had to implement MCP and UCP in “very different” cases, and the biggest problems they’ve r', 'VentureBeat', 'https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/2VCnNmP0CWrEo1sgvW4EaV/fdf8524a18ae6c74af92aaf6cbaf90c5/Brownie_recipe.png?w=300&q=30', 'Wed, 04 Feb 2026 21Z', 'published', 'the-brownie-recipe-problem-why-llms-must-have-fine-graine'),

It&#x27;s small enough to fit almost anywhere.&quot;</p><h2><b>Mistral splits its new AI transcription technology into batch processing and real-time applications</b></h2><p>Mistral released two distinct models under the Voxtral Transcribe 2 banner, each engineered for different use cases.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/models/voxtral-mini-transcribe-26-02"><b>Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2</b></a> handles batch transcription, processing pre-recorded audio files in bulk.

As companies integrate AI into ever more sensitive workflows — transcribing medical consultations, financial advisory calls, legal depositions — the question of where that data travels has become a dealbreaker.</p><p>Stock painted a vivid picture of the problem during his interview. Current note-taking applications with audio capabilities, he explained, often pick up ambient noise in problematic ways: &quot;It might pick up the lyrics of the music in the background. It might pick up another conversation. It might hallucinate from a background noise.&quot;</p><p>Mistral invested heavily in training data curation and model architecture to address these issues. &quot;All of that, we spend a lot of time ironing out the data and the way we train the model to robustify it,&quot; Stock said.</p><p>The company also added enterprise-specific features that its American competitors have been slower to implement.

While 2025 was the year senior engineers began to take AI vibe  coding seriously, Kilo believes 2026 will be defined by the adoption of agents that can manage end-to-end tasks independently. </p><p>The new CLI is built on an MIT-licensed, open-source foundation, specifically designed to function in terminal sessions where developers often find themselves during critical production incidents or deep infrastructure work.</p><p>For Breitenother, building in the open is non-negotiable: “When you build in the open, you build better products. You get this great flywheel of contributors... your community is not just passive users. They&#x27;re actually part of your team that&#x27;s helping you develop your product... Honestly, some people might say open source is a weakness, but I think it&#x27;s our superpower.”</p><p>The core of this “agentic” experience is Kilo’s ability to move beyond simple autocompletion. The CLI supports multiple operational modes:</p><ul><li><p><b>Code Mode: </b>For high-speed generation and multi-file refactors.</p></li><li><p><b>Architect Mode:</b> For high-level planning and technical strategy.</p></li><li><p><b>Debug Mode:</b> For systematic problem diagnosis and resolution.</p></li></ul><h3>Solving multi-session memory</h3><p>To solve the persistent issue of “AI amnesia”—where an agent loses context between sessions—Kilo utilizes a “Memory Bank” feature. </p><p>This system maintains state by storing context in structured Markdown files within the repository, ensuring that an agent operating in the CLI has the same understanding of the codebase as the one working in a VS Code sidebar or a Slack thread. </p><p>The synergy between the new CLI and “Kilo for Slack” is central to the company’s “Agentic Anywhere” strategy. Launched in January, the Slack integration allows teams to fix bugs and push pull requests directly from a conversation.</p><p>Unlike competing integrations from Cursor or Claude Code —which Kilo claims are limited by single-repo configurations or a lack of persistent thread state — Kilo’s bot can ingest context from across multiple repositories simultaneously.</p><p>“Engineering teams don&#x27;t make decisions in IDE sidebars. They make them in Slack,” Breitenother emphasized. </p><h2>Extensibility and t', 'VentureBeat', 'https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/1uSTkwPRqMxlqN1HODf37R/05dea6bb9b12e0fddcd04eb430ca294c/TU-TjTY5HavJEByJadVee.jpg?w=300&q=30', 'Wed, 04 Feb 2026 20Z', 'published', 'kilo-cli-1-0-brings-open-source-vibe-coding-to-your-terminal'),

CIOs and technical leaders are asking why their pilot programs, even those designed to automate the simplest of workflows, aren’t delivering the magic promised in demos.</p><p>When AI fails to answer a basic question or complete an action correctly, the instinct is to blame the model. We assume the LLM isn’t &quot;smart&quot; enough. But that blame is misplaced. AI doesn’t struggle because it lacks <i>intelligence</i>. It struggles because it lacks <i>context</i>.</p><p>In the modern enterprise, context is trapped in a maze of disconnected point solutions, brittle APIs, and latency-ridden integrations — a “Franken-stack” of disparate technologies. And for services-centric organizations in particular, where the real truth of the business lives in the handoffs between sales, delivery, success, and finance, this fragmentation is existential. If your architecture walls off these functions, your AI roadmap is destined for failure.</p><h2>Context can’t travel through an API</h2><p>For the last decade, the standard IT strategy was &quot;best-of-breed.&quot; You bought the best CRM for sales, a separate tool for managing projects, a standalone CSP for success, and an ERP for finance; stitched them together with APIs and middleware (if you were lucky), and declared victory.</p><p>For human workers, this was annoying but manageable. A human knows that the project status in the project management tool might be 72 hours behind the invoice data in the ERP. Humans possess the intuition to bridge the gap between systems.</p><p>But AI doesn’t have intuition. It has queries. When you ask an AI agent to “staff this new project we won for margin and utilization impact,&quot; it executes a query based on the data it can access now. If your architecture relies on integrations to move data, the AI is working with a delay. It sees the signed contract, but not the resource shortage. It sees the revenue target, but not the churn risk.</p><p>The result is not only a wrong answer, but a confident, plausible-sounding wrong answer based on partial truths. Acting on that creates <a href="https://assets.certinia.com/download/ef20293a748011f0ab9f0a6ae67079f6">costly operational pitfalls</a> that go far beyond failed AI pilots alone.</p><h2>Why agentic AI requires a platform-native architecture</h2><p>This is why the conversation is shifting from &quot;<i>which model should we use?</i>&quot; to &quot;<i>where does our data live?</i>&quot;</p><p>To support a hybrid workforce where human experts work alongside duly capable AI agents, the underlying data can’t be stitched together; it must be native to the core business platform. A <a href="https://www.certinia.com/solutions/salesforce-native/?utm_source=venturebeat&amp;utm_campaign=ucj-nam-software-ent-mofu&amp;utm_content=exec-leadership">platform-native approach</a>, specifically one built on a common data model (e.g. Salesforce), eliminates the translation layer and provides the single source of truth that good, reliable AI requires.</p><p>In a native environment, data lives in a single object model. A scope change in delivery is a revenue change in finance. There is no sync, no latency, and no loss of state.</p><p>This is the only way to achieve real certainty with AI. If you want an agent to autonomously staff a project or forecast revenue, it’s going to require a 360-degree view of the truth, not a series of snapshots taped together by middleware.</p><h2>The security tax of the side door: APIs as attack surface</h2><p>Once you solve for intelligence, you must solve for sovereignty. The argument for a unified platform is usually framed around efficiency, but an increasingly pressing argument is security.</p><p>In a best-of-breed Franken-stack, every API connection you build is effectively a new door you have to lock. When you rely on third-party point solutions for critical functions like customer success or resource management, you’re constantly piping sensitive customer data out of your core system of record and into satellite apps. This movement <i>is</i> the risk.</p><p>We’ve seen this play out in recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/google-says-hackers-stole-data-from-200-companies-following-gainsight-breach/">high-profile supply chain breaches</a>. Hackers didn&#x27;t need to storm the castle gates of the core platform. They simply walked in through the side door by exploiting the persistent authentication tokens of connected third-party apps.</p><p>A platform-native strategy solves this through security by inheritance. When your data stays resident on a single platform, it inherits the massive security investment and trust boundary of that platform. You aren&#x27;t moving data across the wire to a different vendor’s cloud just to analyze it. The gold never leaves the vault.</p><h2><b>Fix the architecture, then curate', 'VentureBeat', 'https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/58YwKHSii6aFW7y6qcmo7S/0eeeefb86415491b1608d41f1d7b150b/AdobeStock_338505208.jpeg?w=300&q=30', 'Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05Z', 'published', 'the-hidden-tax-of-franken-stacks-that-sabotages-ai-strateg'),

From the massive efficiency gains of<a href="https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/claude-codes-tasks-update-lets-agents-work-longer-and-coordinate-across"> Anthropic’s Claude Code harness </a>to the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/openai-launches-a-codex-desktop-app-for-macos-to-run-multiple-ai-coding">high-profile launch of the OpenAI Codex app</a> and the rapid community adoption of open-source frameworks like <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/openclaw-agentic-ai-security-risk-ciso-guide">OpenClaw</a>, the competitive landscape has never been more crowded. </p><p>In this high-stakes environment, Alibaba isn&#x27;t just keeping pace — it is attempting to set a new standard for open-weight intelligence.</p><p>For LLM decision-makers, Qwen3-Coder-Next represents a fundamental shift in the economics of AI engineering. While the model houses 80 billion total parameters, it utilizes an ultra-sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that activates only 3 billion parameters per forward pass. </p><p>This design allows it to deliver reasoning capabilities that rival massive proprietary systems while maintaining the low deployment costs and high throughput of a lightweight local model.</p><h2>Solving the long-context bottleneck</h2><p>The core technical breakthrough behind Qwen3-Coder-Next is a hybrid architecture designed specifically to circumvent the quadratic scaling issues that plague traditional Transformers. </p><p>As context windows expand — and this model supports a massive 262,144 tokens — traditional attention mechanisms become computationally prohibitive. </p><p>Standard Transformers suffer from a &quot;memory wall&quot; where the cost of processing context grows quadratically with sequence length. Qwen addresses this by combining Gated DeltaNet with Gated Attention.</p><p>Gated DeltaNet acts as a linear-complexity alternative to standard softmax attention. It allows the model to maintain state across its quarter-million-token window without the exponential latency penalties typical of long-horizon reasoning. </p><p>When paired with the ultra-sparse MoE, the result is a theoretical 10x higher throughput for repository-level tasks compared to dense models of similar total capacity. </p><p>This architecture ensures an agent can &quot;read&quot; an entire Python library or complex JavaScript framework and respond with the speed of a 3B model, yet with the structural understanding of an 80B system. </p><p>To prevent context hallucination during training, the team utilized Best-Fit Packing (BFP), a strategy that maintains efficiency without the truncation errors found in traditional document concatenation.</p><h2>Trained to be agent-first</h2><p>The &quot;Next&quot; in the model&#x27;s nomenclature refers to a fundamental pivot in training methodology. Historically, coding models were trained on static code-text pairs—essentially a &quot;read-only&quot; education. Qwen3-Coder-Next was instead developed through a massive &quot;agentic training&quot; pipeline. </p><p>The technical report details a synthesis pipeline that produced 800,000 verifiable coding tasks. These were not mere snippets; they were real-world bug-fixing scenarios mined from GitHub pull requests and paired with fully executable environments.</p><p>The training infrastructure, known as MegaFlow, is a cloud-native orchestration system based on Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes.

It answers questions based on what the developer provides, but it doesn&#x27;t have access to the full context of the project, and it&#x27;s not able to take action on its own. That changes with this update, the company said during a press conference Tuesday morning.</p><h2><b>How Apple&#x27;s new AI coding features let developers build apps faster than ever</b></h2><p>The key innovation in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/xcode-26-point-3-unlocks-the-power-of-agentic-coding/">Xcode 26.3</a> is the depth of integration between AI agents and Apple&#x27;s development tools. Unlike previous iterations that offered code suggestions and autocomplete features, the new system grants AI agents access to nearly every aspect of the development process.</p><p>During a live demonstration, an Apple engineer showed how the Claude agent could receive a simple prompt — &quot;add a new feature to show the weather at a landmark&quot; — and then independently analyze the project&#x27;s file structure, consult Apple&#x27;s documentation, write the necessary code, build the project, and take screenshots of the running application to verify its work matched the requested design.</p><p>According to Apple, the agent is able to use tools like build and screenshot previews to verify its work, visually analyze the image, and confirm that everything has been built accordingly. Before, when interacting with a model, it would provide an answer and just stop there.</p><p>The system creates automatic checkpoints as developers interact with the AI, allowing them to roll back changes if results prove unsatisfactory — a safeguard that acknowledges the unpredictable nature of AI-generated code.</p><p>Apple says it worked directly with <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> to optimize the experience with particular attention paid to reducing token usage — the computational units that determine costs when using cloud-based AI models — and improving the efficiency of tool calling.</p><p>According to the company, developers can download new agents with a single click, and they update automatically.</p><h2><b>Why Apple&#x27;s adoption of the Model Context Protocol could reshape the AI development landscape</b></h2><p>Underlying the integration is the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro">Model Context Protocol</a>, or MCP, an open standard that Anthropic developed for connecting AI agents with external tools. Apple&#x27;s adoption of MCP means that any compatible agent — not just Claude or Codex — can now interact with Xcode&#x27;s capabilities.</p><p>Apple says this also works for agents that are running outside of Xcode. Any agent that is compatible with MCP can now work with Xcode to do all the same things — project discovery and change management, building and testing apps, working with previews and code snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.</p><p>The decision to embrace an open protocol, rather than building a proprietary system, represents a notable departure for Apple, which has historically favored closed ecosystems. It also positions Xcode as a potential hub for a growing universe of AI development tools.</p><h2><b>Xcode&#x27;s troubled history with AI tools — and why Apple says this time is different</b></h2><p>The announcement comes against a backdrop of mixed experiences with AI-assisted coding in Appl', 'VentureBeat', 'https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/2Q8OGhbv336AGtWlkPE9wO/51480cf6096208fab81a5f6c184a9a20/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_Apple_logo_inside_code_brackets_63cd7c00-dd68-44a7-b323-831a5a2226c0.webp?w=300&q=30', ' ue, 03 Feb 2026 20Z', 'published', 'apple-integrates-anthropic-s-claude-and-openai-s-codex-into'),

Early adopters, including easyJet, Hafnia and Warner Music Group, are cutting application delivery times by 75 to 95%, but the deeper architectural innovation positions databases as ephemeral, self-service infrastructure that AI agents can provision and manage without human intervention.</p><p>This isn&#x27;t just another managed Postgres service. Lakebase treats operational databases as lightweight, disposable compute running on data lake storage rather than monolithic systems requiring careful capacity planning and database administrator (DBA) oversight.</p><p> &quot;Really, for the vibe coding trend to take off, you need developers to believe they can actually create new apps very quickly, but you also need the central IT team, or DBAs, to be comfortable with the tsunami of apps and databases,&quot; Databricks co-founder Reynold Xin told VentureBeat. &quot;Classic databases simply won&#x27;t scale to that because they can&#x27;t afford to put a DBA per database and per app.&quot;</p><h2>92% faster delivery: From two months to five days</h2><p>The production numbers demonstrate immediate impact beyond the agent provisioning vision. Hafnia reduced delivery time for production-ready applications from two months to five days — or 92% — using Lakebase as the transactional engine for their internal operations portal. The shipping company moved beyond static BI reports to real-time business applications for fleet, commercial and finance workflows.</p><p>EasyJet consolidated more than 100 Git repositories into just two and cut development cycles from nine months to four months — a 56% reduction — while building a web-based revenue management hub on Lakebase to replace a decade-old desktop app and one of Europe&#x27;s largest legacy SQL Server environments.</p><p>Warner Music Group is moving insights directly into production systems using the unified foundation, while Quantum Capital Group uses it to maintain consistent, governed data for identifying and evaluating oil and gas investments — eliminating the data duplication that previously forced teams to maintain multiple copies in different formats.</p><p>The acceleration stems from the elimination of two major bottlenecks: database cloning for test environments and ETL pipeline maintenance for syncing operational and analytical data.</p><h2>Technical architecture: Why this isn&#x27;t just managed Postgres</h2><p>Traditional databases couple storage and compute — organizations provision a database instance with attached storage and scale by adding more instances or storage. AWS Aurora innovated by separating these layers using proprietary storage, but the storage remained locked inside AWS&#x27;s ecosystem and wasn&#x27;t independently accessible for analytics.</p><p>Lakebase takes the separation of storage and compute to its logical conclusion by putting storage directly in the data lakehouse. The compute layer runs essentially vanilla PostgreSQL— maintaining full compatibility with the Postgres ecosystem — but every write goes to lakehouse storage in formats that Spark, Databricks SQL and other analytics engines can immediately query without ETL.</p><p>&quot;The unique technical insight was that data lakes decouple storage from compute, which was great, but we need to introduce data management capabilities like governance and transaction management into the data lake,&quot; Xin explained. &quot;We&#x27;re actually not that different from the lakehouse concept, but we&#x27;re building lightweight, ephemeral compute for OLTP databases on top.&quot;</p><p>Databricks built Lakebase with the technology it gained from the acquisition of Neon.
